                            The aruval (Tamil and Malayalam), is a type of billhook machete
                            from southern India, particularly common in the Indian states of
                            Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In Kerala, its primary use is for agriculture, mainly in coconut
                            cutting, clearing pathways, cutting wood and other uses.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            These are made of iron blade material which is fixed to a wooden
                            handle.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            An aruval usually measures 3–6 feet in length (hand sickle
                            measures 1.5 feet).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The blade of this weapon originates at the grip and extends to
                            the main part of the blade.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It can be described as a sickle with an extension. The shorter
                            version is usually seen in small villages.

                            Blades are mostly straight with a curve towards the end,
                            allowing it to function as a grabbing tool.

                            A baler or hay baler is a piece of farm machinery used to
                            compress a cut and raked crop (such as hay, cotton, flax straw,
                            salt marsh hay, or silage) into compact bales that are easy to
                            handle, transport, and store.

                            In agriculture, a harrow (often called a set of harrows in a
                            plurale tantum sense) is an implement for breaking up and
                            smoothing out the surface of the soil.

                        <li>
                            In this way it is distinct in its effect from the plough, which
                            is used for deeper tillage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough
                            finish left by plowing operations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The purpose of this harrowing is generally to break up clods
                            (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a good tilth or
                            soil structure that is suitable for seedbed use.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Harrows were originally drawn by draft animals, such as horses,
                            mules, or oxen, or in some times and places by manual labourers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A modern development of the traditional harrow is the rotary
                            power harrow, often just called a power harrow.

                            A mattock has a shaft, typically made of wood, which is 3–4 ft (0.9–1.2 m) long.The head
                            consists of two ends, opposite each other and separated by a central eye.

                            axe blade oriented vertically and longer adze horizontally.

                            A plough or plow is a farm tool for loosening or turning the soil before
                            sowing seed or planting. Ploughs were traditionally drawn by oxen and horses, but in
                            modern farms are drawn by tractors.

                            Celtic peoples first came to use wheeled ploughs in the Roman era.The prime purpose of
                            ploughing is to turn over the uppermost soil,bringing fresh nutrients to the surface while
                            burying weeds and crop remains to decay.

                            The prices ranges from 10000 Rs to 100000 depending on the tool if it is a machine or

                            The roller is an agricultural tool used for flattening land or breaking up large clumps of
                            soil, especially after ploughing or disc harrowing.

                            Typically, rollers are pulled by tractors or, prior to mechanisation, a team of animals such
                            as horses or oxen.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As well as for agricultural purposes, rollers are used on cricket pitches and residential
                            lawn areas.

                        <li>
                            Flatter land makes subsequent weed control and harvesting easier, and rolling can help to
                            reduce moisture loss from cultivated soil.

                            On lawns, rolling levels the land for mowing and compacts the soil surface.

                            A cultivator is a multifunctional tractor attachment that is mainly used for the preparation
                            of the soil before sowing with the help of minimum labour, fuel and time required.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It helps farmers to uproot weeds and mix crop residue, manure and fertilizers with the soil.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It’s really helpful to farmers as it can be also used after sowing the crops to stir up the
                            soil near them, hence helping the crops to get the proper temperature and a healthy
                            environment to grow.
